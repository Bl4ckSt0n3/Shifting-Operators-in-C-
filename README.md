# Shifting-Operators-in-C-
## shifting left and right using different type in C language

The numbers can be shown as binary therefore we have to evaluate them as binary when we apply shifting. <br />
Let us demonstrate some of numbers in 8 bit and after that shift left and right. <br />

For example; <br />
<pre>int a = 12; then a = 0000 1100 or int b = 2; then b = 0000 0010 </pre>
Now if we apply left or right shift to these numbers then shifting left or right as a whole.

### Left Shift
Using '<<' character for the left shift and then we can say that its syntax  'value << number'  like this. <br />
We have a binary number 0001 0001 (decimal 17) and aplly left shift one time (00010001 << 1);
<pre>0001 0001 << 1 -> 0010 0010</pre>
